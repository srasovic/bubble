# Multi-protocol fuzzer tool


I didn't have time to make this script what it should be in this iteration. Next iteration will have a better vesion of init.sh script.

The following steps need to be performed for successful instalation:

1. Run init.sh script from scripts directory:

    user@machine:~/fuzz$ sudo sh scripts/init.sh
    
2. After succesfull instalation, run 'make' to build the tool
